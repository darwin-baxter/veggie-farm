# veggie-farm
An online veggie shop built in native node.js

This application uses modules- http,fs,url,slugify.
It is made on node.js, completely free of any frameworks, built only and only to solidify the skills in native Node programming.

## The concepts used in the project are as follows :

1. Reading files from the system using the FS module, synchronously, so that it doesn't have to be read again and again,while the application is running.
2. Parsing the data into Json and String back and forth.
3. A layman,s attempt at Creating an API.
4. Attempt at creating a Routes in a website, by using the url.parse(req.url) to gather information.
5. Creating our own modules and then incorporating then into our project.
6. Mapping data in the dataObj inorder to create the templates dynamically.
7. Creating templates in order to render different contents using a single html rather than creating multiple html files.
